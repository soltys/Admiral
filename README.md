# Concept
The game in Poland was called “Manewry Morskie” (Naval Maneuvers?). Anyway the idea is to beat your opponent with your navy fleet, or rather with your clever and cunning actions. The game introduces complexity of different variety of ships like for instance: submarines, destroyers, ship missile etc. On top of this some ships have different ranges. In addition each player has own starting setup which of course is unknown to his or her enemy.

People who used to play this game, will immediately recognize it by these remarkable pawns…
